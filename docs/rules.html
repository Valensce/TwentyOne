        <h1>GOAL:</h1>
        <h3>To beat the dealer, the player must score higher than the dealer in seven rounds</h3>
        
       <h1>HOW TO PLAY:</h1>
        <p>1. The dealer deals two cards for themself; one card is facing up and the other is facing down.<br><br>
        
        2. The dealer then deals two cards to the player; both cards are facing up.<br><br>
        
        3. The player must select one of the following options:<br><br>
            <strong>Sit: No changes are made to the player's hand. The dealer reveals their hidden card.<br><br><br></strong>
                - If the dealer's hand has a higher value than the player's hand, <br>
                the dealer wins the round.<br>
                - If the player's hand is greater than the dealer's hand, <br>
                the player wins the round.<br>
                - Else, the player ties with the dealer.<br><br><br>
        
              <strong>Hit: The player receives another card.<br><br></strong>
                - If the player's hand has a value greater than 21, <br>
                the player is bust and the dealer wins the round.<br>
                - If the player's hand has not gone bust and is greater than the dealer's hand,<br>
                the player has won the round.
